I do a PhD at the University of Amsterdam, advised by Erman Acar and Jelle Zuidema. I work jointly in the IvI faculty (SIAS group) and ILLC. My research is broadly on (mechanistic) interpretability of deep learning models that impact society. I hold a MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Amsterdam and a BSc in Technical Computer Science and BSc in Applied Mathematics from the University of Twente.
